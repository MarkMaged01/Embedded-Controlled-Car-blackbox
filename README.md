# Team45_M3
A Bluetooth-controlled car using the Arduino RP2040 with manual and auto modes. Manual mode supports multi-speed control via Bluetooth commands. Auto mode detects collisions, logs data (speed, acceleration, rotation, temperature), and triggers alerts. Powered by a lithium battery, it simulates a black box system with real-time monitoring.
